                              jupyter notebook project


this is my first README.md file i have ever created in terminal!! hooray!!! i typed nano README.md and now 
i can write inside a very awful and old GUI! i am so excited! not really. feels like adding README.md files
directly from github is easier. idk we will see.So, in this repository we will see how we can process
different datas with jupyter. Also, we need to install Pandas, Pandas is a Python library used for
 working with data sets. all we have to do is open our terminal, and type 'jupyter notebook' to install jupyter
 and pip install pandas to install the pandas library. My goal is to get familiar working with datasets and
datas so i can improve my data analytics skills! and who knows! maybe this is the career path i will follow! Anyways, thanks for reading this and have a good day!
